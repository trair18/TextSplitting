A simple, constructor program in java.
	Here we have created an object obj of class Hello and then we displayed the instance variable name of the object.
	As you can see that the output is BeginnersBook.com which is what we have passed to the name during initialization in constructor.
This shows that when we created the object obj the constructor got invoked. In this example we have used this keyword, which refers to the current object, object obj in this example. We will cover this keyword in detail in the next tutorial.
	/*#public class Hello {
   String name;
   //Constructor
   Hello(){
      this.name = "BeginnersBook.com";
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Hello obj = new Hello();
      System.out.println(obj.name);
   }
}
